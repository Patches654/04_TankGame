Design Brief


Game - 

Tank Game


So this game will be a 2 player VR game
With Various Low Poly Environments
Thinking about Large Building Blocks shaped as buildings that can be exploded and moved
so the city is kindof completely destructable, roads fences, light poles, can be run over and moved

the sound would have no music, just the sound of the tank engines and the reverb from buildings and surroundings
